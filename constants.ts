Edit this image. Identify the main subject (person or animal). 
Place an orange baseball cap on their head (similar to a MAGA hat style).
On the front of the cap, write the text "MAKE BONK" on the top line and "GREAT AGAIN" on the bottom line in white, bold, legible text.
Ensure the cap fits naturally on the head. Maintain the original background.

export const PROMPT_BONK = `
Edit this image. Identify the main subject's head.
Apply a strong, comical "bonk" effect where the TOP of the head is visibly flattened and squashed downwards, as if struck heavily from above.
The head shape should be distorted to look compressed vertically and expanded horizontally.
The top surface must be flat, appearing crunched down.
Floating immediately above the flattened area, add the text "*BONK*" in a bold, comic-book style font (yellow or orange text with thick black outline).
Add a few small cartoon stars or dizzy lines around the head to emphasize the impact.
Keep the rest of the body and background unchanged.
